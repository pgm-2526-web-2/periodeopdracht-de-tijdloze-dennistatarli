# WEB2 Project - De Tijdloze

# Info

- Had problems with Github, worked a bit on the project without Github (wrote all code for the loading screen). Initial commit has code for the website.
- Working with utilities (similar to Tailwind CSS)

# To-do's

[] Border-bottom of list-tabs stretches from screen border to screen border
[] Add floating badge on list-rank
[] Change list-favorite to button as this is a "like" button
[] Cursor pointer on hero-button
[] Make list-rank & list-favorite smaller (maybe better)
[] Fix bottom bar -> too big, "De Lijst" icon messed up
[] Fix font-weights for different text (LATO DOES NOT HAVE OTHER FW THAN NORMAL AND BOLD?)
[] Add animations for buttons and links
