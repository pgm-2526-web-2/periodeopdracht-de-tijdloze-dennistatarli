# WEB2 Project - De Tijdloze

# Info

- Had problems with Github, worked a bit on the project without Github (wrote all code for the loading screen). Initial commit has code for the website.
- Working with utilities (similar to Tailwind CSS)

# To-do's

[X] Add floating badge on list-rank
[X] Change list-favorite to button as this is a "like" button
[X] Cursor pointer on hero-button
[X] Make list-rank & list-favorite smaller (maybe better)
[X] Fix bottom bar -> too big, "De Lijst" icon messed up
[X] Add animations for buttons and links
[X] Tab text is accent color -> change to black when active
[X] Logo mobile is clickable full width -> fix
[X] Change things from HTML utilities to CSS
[] Border-bottom of list-tabs stretches from screen border to screen border
[] Fix font-weights for different text (LATO DOES NOT HAVE OTHER FW THAN NORMAL AND BOLD?)
